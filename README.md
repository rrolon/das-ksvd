# DasKsvd: Discriminant Atom Selection KSVD

A method for structured dictionary learning specially designed to tackle multiclass classification problems. DasKsvd is an iterative method that makes use of a multiclass discriminant measure for properly identifying and selecting the most discriminant dictionary atoms. For a given dictionary, this measure, which takes into account not only when a particular atom is used for representing pattern coming from a certain class and the magnitude of its corresponding representation coefficient, but also the effect that such an atom has in the total representation error, is capable of efficiently quantifying the degree of discriminability of each one of the atoms. On the other hand, the new dictionary construction method yields dictionaries which are highly suitable for multi-class classification tasks.
